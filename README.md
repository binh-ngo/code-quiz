# code-quiz

## Description
I created an online quiz that tests your proficiency in the subject of food. After clicking the Start Quiz button, the "greeting" div will disappear, then have the "Quiz" div appear. This div will show one question and 4 possible answers for that question. The user will also know that they have 150 seconds to complete the quiz. Whenever the user gets a question wrong, 12 seconds will be deducted from the time which will ultimately represent the user's total amount of points. If the user clicks on the correct answer, a "thumbs up" will appear, otherwise, a "thumbs down" will appear. After completing the quiz, the user will see their final score and have the opportunity to post their score and intitials on their leaderboard.
